The legislation would provide $36.5 billion in emergency relief as Puerto Rico in particular struggles to regain electricity and other basic services following destructive hurricanes. The House of Representatives approved the bill earlier this month. The Trump administration already has indicated it will seek another round of emergency relief from Congress. \",\n          \"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - About a thousand Hungarians protested on Friday against a crackdown on the main opposition party Jobbik which has been  threatened by a record political campaign fine that the party leader describes as a  death sentence  for democracy. Despite the gloomy rhetoric and Jobbik saying it was fighting for survival, support for the demonstration was well down on other similar rallies over the past year. Hungarians will vote for a new parliament in April and Prime Minister Viktor Orban s conservative, anti-migrant Fidesz party is far ahead in the polls, with Jobbik its nearest rival. Jobbik, once on the far right, has turned toward the center in a bid to attract more support and is now campaigning nationwide against Orban, depicting him as the leader of a criminal gang. Orban, rejecting the charges, says his financial standing is  an open book . Last week the state audit office (ASZ) ruled Jobbik had bought political posters far below market prices, breaching rules on political funding, then it slapped a 663 million forint ($2.5 million) penalty on the party. The protesters, waving Jobbik flags and posters deriding the ruling elite, gathered outside the headquarters of Orban s Fidesz party.  What we see unfolding is not an audit office investigation. It is not an official penalty. This is a death sentence with Jobbik s name on it. But in reality, it is a death sentence for Hungarian democracy,  Jobbiik leader Gabor Vona told the crowd. A government spokesman could not comment immediately on his remarks. ASZ chairman Laszlo Domokos is a former Fidesz lawmaker, whom Jobbik and other critics accuse of making decisions in favor of Orban. The audit office denies that. On Friday, ASZ again called on Jobbik to submit information that would challenge its findings, saying it acted fully within its rights throughout the probe. The ruling Fidesz party and the government have denied any involvement in the ASZ probe.  This case has nothing to do with the election campaign,  Orban aide Janos Lazar said on Thursday. For over a year Fidesz has targeted Jobbik, whose move to the center could upend the longstanding status quo of a dominant Fidesz with weaker opponents to its left and its right, said analyst Zoltan Novak at the Centre for Fair Political Analysis. Gyorgy Illes, a 67-year-old pensioner attending the rally, said he used to be a Socialist supporter but got disillusioned as the party struggled to overcome its internal divisions.  This ASZ probe is a clear sign that Orban is way past any remedy. It is a ruthless attack on everything we hold dear. Democracy, the rule of law, equality, you name it,  he said. \",\n          \"BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - China accused the United States on Thursday of interfering in its internal affairs and said it had lodged a complaint after U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law an act laying the groundwork for possible U.S. navy visits to self-ruled Taiwan. Tensions have risen in recent days after a senior Chinese diplomat threatened China would invade Taiwan if any U.S. warships made port visits to the island which China claims as its own territory. On Monday, Chinese jets carried out  island encirclement patrols  around Taiwan, with state media showing pictures of bombers with cruise missiles slung under their wings as they carried out the exercise. On Tuesday, Trump signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2018 fiscal year, which authorizes the possibility of mutual visits by navy vessels between Taiwan and the United States. Such visits would be the first since the United States ended formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 and established ties with Beijing. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said while the Taiwan sections of the law were not legally binding, they seriously violate the  One China  policy and  constitute an interference in China s internal affairs .   China is resolutely opposed to this, and we have already lodged stern representations with the U.S. government,  Lu told a daily news briefing. China is firmly opposed to any official exchanges, military contact, or arms sales between Taiwan and the United States, he added.  Proudly democratic Taiwan has become increasingly concerned with the ramped up Chinese military presence, that has included several rounds of Chinese air force drills around the island in recent months.  Taiwan is confident of its defenses and responded quickly to the Chinese air force drills this week, its government said, denouncing the rise in China s military deployments as irresponsible. Taiwan presidential spokesman Alex Huang, speaking to Taiwan media in comments reported late on Wednesday, said the defense ministry had kept a close watch on the patrols and responded immediately and properly. Taiwan  can ensure there are no concerns at all about national security, and people can rest assured , Huang said. Both sides of the narrow Taiwan Strait, which separates Taiwan from its giant neighbor, have a responsibility to protect peace and stability, he added.  Such a raised military posture that may impact upon and harm regional peace and stability and cross-strait ties does not give a feeling of responsibility, and the international community does not look favorably upon this,  Huang was quoted as saying. Relations have soured considerably since Tsai Ing-wen, who leads Taiwan s independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, won presidential elections last year. China suspects Tsai wants to declare the island s formal independence, a red line for Beijing. Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan s security. Taiwan is well equipped with mostly U.S. weapons but has been pressing for more advanced equipment to deal with what it sees as a rising threat from China. The United States is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself. China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"worldnews\",\n          \"politicsNews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 716,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"September 2, 2017 \",\n          \"February 2, 2017 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

According to the Clinical Trials website, run by the National Institutes of Health, participants must be at least 14 years old and 18-24 weeks pregnant.The controversial study, led by Bliss Kaneshiro, MD and Kate Whitehouse, DO, will monitor bleeding during D&E abortions to determine the effects of the drug oxytocin, commonly used to minimize blood loss and decrease the risk of hemorrhage.The clinical trial, called  Effects of Oxytocin on Bleeding Outcomes during Dilation and Evacuation  began in October 2014 and is a collaboration between UH, Society of Family Planning and the University of Washington.The Society of Family Planning funds a number of similar research projects, such as experimenting with the dosage of Misoprostol, a uterine contracting agent, prior to surgical abortions at 13-18 weeks and exploring umbilical cord injections to produce fetal death prior to late-term abortions.In the UH study, researchers will carry out a  randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials,  to determine the effect of oxytocin s use on uterine bleeding, meaning that they will either provide or deny intravenous oxytocin to the women.Reports suggest that some doctors are concerned that withholding oxytocin during surgery may put patients, especially teen girls, at risk. This study is reminiscent of Nazi concentration camp experiments. I pity the poor women who are being treated like lab rats, especially those who are denied the drug to reduce hemorrhaging,  said Troy Newman, President of Operation Rescue.Dilation and evacuation abortions are surgical procedures that involve dismembering the pre-born baby with forceps, scraping the inside of the uterus with a curette to remove any residuals and finally suctioning out the womb to make sure the contents are completely removed.After the abortion, the corpse of the fetus is reassembled and examined to ensure everything was successfully removed and that the abortion was complete.The study is hoping to attract up to 166 test subjects and is expected to conclude in July 2015.Via: Breitbart News\",\n          \"CNN was quick to scoop up Corey Lewandowski after Donald Trump kicked him out of his role as campaign manager, but his first week on the job is going pretty much exactly how you would expect it to go   terribly.Not only has Lewandowski proven himself to be pretty much like a paid spokesman for Trump, but his defense of the disgraced GOP candidate isn t being received well. Earlier this week, Lewandowski revealed that he was under contract and couldn t criticize The Donald, even after being fired from the campaign. Today, Lewandowski got called out by Hillary Clinton surrogate Christine Quinn for hyping Trump up to be an expert on the Brexit decision   a suggestion that was clearly false.On Monday s edition of CNN s New Day, Lewandowski made another pathetic defense of Trump by trying to reframe the candidate s disgusting reaction to Brexit, where he mostly spoke about how much the decision would be good for his Scotland golf resort. Lewandowski s defense was: Obviously the U.S. dollar has become much stronger now against the British pound. If you re going to spend money in Europe, now would actually be a good time to go with the fall of the pound.What you have is a world view, so what you have is someone who is saying,  Let s look at this from the U.S. perspective. If you want to go and travel overseas   just from a monetary perspective   now is the right time to do that because what you re getting is more for your dollar. Quinn wasn t having it. She ripped into Lewandowski, firing back, Donald Trump is not running to be travel agent of the world, he s running to be president of the United States.  She continued: What he said wasn t a commentary on international markets, it was,  When the pound goes down, more people will come to my golf course. Donald Trump s main concern isn t the international markets, it isn t the impact that Brexit will have on hard working Americans  401Ks, it s himself. How can he make more money, how can he put more money in his bank account? Lewandowski compared the Brexit decision to Trump s rise in the GOP, and Quinn once again called him out and put him back in his place. She said: Trump touted that he saw this coming. That s ridiculous because when he was first asked about Brexit by the press, he didn t appear to know what it was. Lewandowski tried to counter by insisting that People are too smart, they are tired of being told what to do.  He then tried to commend Trump for being a selfish moron: You know what Donald Trump said about Brexit? What he said was, you don t have to listen to me because it s not my decision. He didn t weigh in like Hillary Clinton did, like Barack Obama did, saying that you can t do this. Quinn fought back, Because he didn t know what it was. Lewandowski was fighting a losing battle. Trump s reaction to Brexit was just as terrifying as it was humorous   it truly proved that Trump knows nothing about foreign affairs, and hasn t spent any time educating himself since the beginning of his presidential candidacy. If only some of the hours he spent getting into fights on Twitter were being used for learning about how the world works. But instead, he once again exposed himself as an unfit choice for President. And when people like Lewandowski try to make sense of his idiocy, they only make themselves look equally foolish.You can watch the embarrassing video below:Featured image via screen capture\",\n          \"A Michigan woman decided to defend against tyranny? when she and another shopper couldn t agree over who got to buy the last notebook on the shelf at the Novi Towne Center store.According to ABC 13, the brawl   yes, brawl    involved two Farmington Hills residents, ages 46 and 32, and a mother and daughter from South Lyon, ages 51 and 20.

            "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of a conservative Republican faction in the U.S. Congress, who voted this month for a huge expansion of the national debt to pay for tax cuts, called himself a “fiscal conservative” on Sunday and urged budget restraint in 2018. In keeping with a sharp pivot under way among Republicans, U.S. Representative Mark Meadows, speaking on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” drew a hard line on federal spending, which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in January. When they return from the holidays on Wednesday, lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues, such as immigration policy, even as the November congressional election campaigns approach in which Republicans will seek to keep control of Congress. President Donald Trump and his Republicans want a big budget increase in military spending, while Democrats also want proportional increases for non-defense “discretionary” spending on programs that support education, scientific research, infrastructure, public health and environmental protection. “The (Trump) administration has already been willing to say: ‘We’re going to increase non-defense discretionary spending ... by about 7 percent,’” Meadows, chairman of the small but influential House Freedom Caucus, said on the program. “Now, Democrats are saying that’s not enough, we need to give the government a pay raise of 10 to 11 percent. For a fiscal conservative, I don’t see where the rationale is. ... Eventually you run out of other people’s money,” he said. Meadows was among Republicans who voted in late December for their party’s debt-financed tax overhaul, which is expected to balloon the federal budget deficit and add about $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt. “It’s interesting to hear Mark talk about fiscal responsibility,” Democratic U.S. Representative Joseph Crowley said on CBS. Crowley said the Republican tax bill would require the  United States to borrow $1.5 trillion, to be paid off by future generations, to finance tax cuts for corporations and the rich. “This is one of the least ... fiscally responsible bills we’ve ever seen passed in the history of the House of Representatives. I think we’re going to be paying for this for many, many years to come,” Crowley said. Republicans insist the tax package, the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in more than 30 years,  will boost the economy and job growth. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who also supported the tax bill, recently went further than Meadows, making clear in a radio interview that welfare or “entitlement reform,” as the party often calls it, would be a top Republican priority in 2018. In Republican parlance, “entitlement” programs mean food stamps, housing assistance, Medicare and Medicaid health insurance for the elderly, poor and disabled, as well as other programs created by Washington to assist the needy. Democrats seized on Ryan’s early December remarks, saying they showed Republicans would try to pay for their tax overhaul by seeking spending cuts for social programs. But the goals of House Republicans may have to take a back seat to the Senate, where the votes of some Democrats will be needed to approve a budget and prevent a government shutdown. Democrats will use their leverage in the Senate, which Republicans narrowly control, to defend both discretionary non-defense programs and social spending, while tackling the issue of the “Dreamers,” people brought illegally to the country as children. Trump in September put a March 2018 expiration date on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which protects the young immigrants from deportation and provides them with work permits. The president has said in recent Twitter messages he wants funding for his proposed Mexican border wall and other immigration law changes in exchange for agreeing to help the Dreamers. Representative Debbie Dingell told CBS she did not favor linking that issue to other policy objectives, such as wall funding. “We need to do DACA clean,” she said.  On Wednesday, Trump aides will meet with congressional leaders to discuss those issues. That will be followed by a weekend of strategy sessions for Trump and Republican leaders on Jan. 6 and 7, the White House said. Trump was also scheduled to meet on Sunday with Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott, who wants more emergency aid. The House has passed an $81 billion aid package after hurricanes in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico, and wildfires in California. The package far exceeded the $44 billion requested by the Trump administration. The Senate has not yet voted on the aid. \n"

According to the Clinical Trials website, run by the National Institutes of Health, participants must be at least 14 years old and 18-24 weeks pregnant.The controversial study, led by Bliss Kaneshiro, MD and Kate Whitehouse, DO, will monitor bleeding during D&E abortions to determine the effects of the drug oxytocin, commonly used to minimize blood loss and decrease the risk of hemorrhage.The clinical trial, called  Effects of Oxytocin on Bleeding Outcomes during Dilation and Evacuation  began in October 2014 and is a collaboration between UH, Society of Family Planning and the University of Washington.The Society of Family Planning funds a number of similar research projects, such as experimenting with the dosage of Misoprostol, a uterine contracting agent, prior to surgical abortions at 13-18 weeks and exploring umbilical cord injections to produce fetal death prior to late-term abortions.In the UH study, researchers will carry out a  randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials,  to determine the effect of oxytocin s use on uterine bleeding, meaning that they will either provide or deny intravenous oxytocin to the women.Reports suggest that some doctors are concerned that withholding oxytocin during surgery may put patients, especially teen girls, at risk. This study is reminiscent of Nazi concentration camp experiments. I pity the poor women who are being treated like lab rats, especially those who are denied the drug to reduce hemorrhaging,  said Troy Newman, President of Operation Rescue.Dilation and evacuation abortions are surgical procedures that involve dismembering the pre-born baby with forceps, scraping the inside of the uterus with a curette to remove any residuals and finally suctioning out the womb to make sure the contents are completely removed.After the abortion, the corpse of the fetus is reassembled and examined to ensure everything was successfully removed and that the abortion was complete.The study is hoping to attract up to 166 test subjects and is expected to conclude in July 2015.Via: Breitbart News\",\n          \"CNN was quick to scoop up Corey Lewandowski after Donald Trump kicked him out of his role as campaign manager, but his first week on the job is going pretty much exactly how you would expect it to go   terribly.Not only has Lewandowski proven himself to be pretty much like a paid spokesman for Trump, but his defense of the disgraced GOP candidate isn t being received well. Earlier this week, Lewandowski revealed that he was under contract and couldn t criticize The Donald, even after being fired from the campaign. Today, Lewandowski got called out by Hillary Clinton surrogate Christine Quinn for hyping Trump up to be an expert on the Brexit decision   a suggestion that was clearly false.On Monday s edition of CNN s New Day, Lewandowski made another pathetic defense of Trump by trying to reframe the candidate s disgusting reaction to Brexit, where he mostly spoke about how much the decision would be good for his Scotland golf resort. Lewandowski s defense was: Obviously the U.S. dollar has become much stronger now against the British pound. If you re going to spend money in Europe, now would actually be a good time to go with the fall of the pound.What you have is a world view, so what you have is someone who is saying,  Let s look at this from the U.S. perspective. If you want to go and travel overseas   just from a monetary perspective   now is the right time to do that because what you re getting is more for your dollar. Quinn wasn t having it. She ripped into Lewandowski, firing back, Donald Trump is not running to be travel agent of the world, he s running to be president of the United States.  She continued: What he said wasn t a commentary on international markets, it was,  When the pound goes down, more people will come to my golf course. Donald Trump s main concern isn t the international markets, it isn t the impact that Brexit will have on hard working Americans  401Ks, it s himself. How can he make more money, how can he put more money in his bank account? Lewandowski compared the Brexit decision to Trump s rise in the GOP, and Quinn once again called him out and put him back in his place. She said: Trump touted that he saw this coming. That s ridiculous because when he was first asked about Brexit by the press, he didn t appear to know what it was. Lewandowski tried to counter by insisting that People are too smart, they are tired of being told what to do.  He then tried to commend Trump for being a selfish moron: You know what Donald Trump said about Brexit? What he said was, you don t have to listen to me because it s not my decision. He didn t weigh in like Hillary Clinton did, like Barack Obama did, saying that you can t do this. Quinn fought back, Because he didn t know what it was. Lewandowski was fighting a losing battle. Trump s reaction to Brexit was just as terrifying as it was humorous   it truly proved that Trump knows nothing about foreign affairs, and hasn t spent any time educating himself since the beginning of his presidential candidacy. If only some of the hours he spent getting into fights on Twitter were being used for learning about how the world works. But instead, he once again exposed himself as an unfit choice for President. And when people like Lewandowski try to make sense of his idiocy, they only make themselves look equally foolish.You can watch the embarrassing video below:Featured image via screen capture\",\n          \"A Michigan woman decided to defend against tyranny? when she and another shopper couldn t agree over who got to buy the last notebook on the shelf at the Novi Towne Center store.According to ABC 13, the brawl   yes, brawl    involved two Farmington Hills residents, ages 46 and 32, and a mother and daughter from South Lyon, ages 51 and 20. In other words, these were all grown adults who should have known better but hey   there was only one notebook on the shelf, and we ve all seen what happens in those post-apocalyptic movies when a store is down to the last gallon of milk, right?Two of the women, one of whom was the unnamed 20-year-old, reached for the notebook at the same time. The 46 and 32-year-olds apparently decided that she wasn t getting their goddamn notebook and began pulling her hair.Then, because this had almost hit peak  trailer park,  the 20-year-old s mother decided to go for bonus points by pulling out her gun. Fortunately, someone pushed her aside before she could do any harm.This is one of the NRA s  responsible gun owners  (conservatives can t dismiss this one, as it is confirmed that she is a concealed carry permit holder)   ready to leap into action at the most minor sign of danger and make things worse by turning the situation potentially deadly.Watch it happen below:Featured image via screengrab\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"News\",\n          \"politics\",\n          \"Middle-east\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1681,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jun 5, 2015\",\n          \"August 28, 2016\",\n          \"June 3, 2017\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

On Monday morning, George Conway took to Twitter, Trump s favorite medium, to blast the president for his early morning tweets about his Muslim ban.On Saturday evening, Trump exploited the terrorist attacks in London to push for his Muslim ban. Because who cares that this won t keep us safe and only adds fuel to the fire.We need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 3, 2017Then on Monday, Trump really lost his sh*t over his  travel ban  that totally isn t a  ban. People, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!  Donald J.

Sad. https://t.co/zVhcyfm8Hr  George Conway (@gtconway3d) June 5, 2017Conway was at the top of the short list for a job at the Justice Department, but last week he withdrew his name from consideration. It is worth noting that this tweet slamming Trump is the first one Conway has posted since 2015.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images\",\n          \"A former top aide to Donald Trump makes an alarming reference to the safety of American troops in a letter sent to Senator John McCain. In the note, Carter Page insists that an attempt from McCain, Sen. Lindsey Graham, and other Republicans interested in probing the role Russia played in the 2016 election could impact U.S. national security.Page previously served as a foreign policy adviser to Trump, and was under FBI investigation for his communications with the Russian government.In the letter, released to the propaganda site Sputnik (which is financed by the Russian government), Page wrote: Any efforts by members of Congress now to undercut potential new approaches to Russia would risk U.S. national security and innumerable service members lives,  Page said in a letter to McCain, who serves as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, sent late on Tuesday. American citizens are largely tired of failed interventionist policies.   The number of proxy wars involving Washington and Moscow across the globe still put countless lives at risk today,  Page wrote.The Trump team has mounted a full-court press opposing any attempt to investigate and probe Russian attempts to influence the election. Trump himself, responding to President Obama s expulsion of Russian spies and hackers, urged the government to move on from the hacking.The letter from Page appears to be the latest in a coordinated push back on attempts to provide accountability after the election. Republicans have been in an odd position as a result. After decades of pushing back on Russian government, including many of the public statements from Ronald Reagan, they are now backing their incoming president and his praise for the most authoritarian Russian government in decades under Vladimir Putin.By contrast, Democrats have been alarmed at the Russian behavior and Republican disinterest in making them accountable.Featured image via Flickr\",\n          \"It s almost pathetic how quickly and easily our frenemies on the Right jump to hanging people whenever they don t like them. Recently, a West Virginia lawmaker made national headlines when he said the former First Lady hung on the mall in Washington, D.C. Michael Folk, who also worked as a pilot for United Airlines, was suspended indefinitely after his words circulated and his employer was notified. But this sort of thinking, this violent desire to kill one s political enemies, is almost the norm in the GOP.Not only do we hear chants calling for Clinton s arrest and execution at GOP rallies (and even at the convention), but this sort of ugliness rears its head even in local politics. An Ohio lawmaker is under fire after he called for Clinton s execution   not because she has actually committed a crime   but just because he wants her dead.Licking County Commissioner Duane Flowers (R-epugnant), stood in a meeting of the board of commissioners and shared his thoughts Clinton Tuesday. Disgusted that the nation criticized Melania Trump for blatantly stealing part of Michelle Obama s 2008 Democratic National Convention speech, Flowers said that people should be focusing on hanging Hillary. During the meeting, he blurted out:Later in the day, after the criticism began to mount, he sad he regretted the remarks he made while  emotional. I got caught up in an emotional moment,  Flowers said.  She just totally makes my mind want to pop out of my ears. I really can t believe she s running for president. I m convinced 30 years ago, she d been locked up for life. I truly believe she has become above the law,  he added.  That s how far our system has fallen. Clinton, of course, has committed no crimes and the ones of which Republicans say she is guilty would not carry the death penalty (most of them, anyway). Unfortunately, Flowers seems to be a victim of right-wing media s incessant insistence that Clinton is a murderer and many other things she is not. As a Republican, Flowers has no choice given his mindset but to decide she should be dead.Fellow Republican and president of the board, Commissioner Tim Bubb, jumped in to defend Flowers after the remarks went public, saying that his buddy shouldn t be judged for publicly calling for the death of a high-profile political figure. I think he was on a rant and kind of venting,  Bubb said.  He sometimes wears his emotions on his sleeve. I hope you don t characterize it as that s all he is. There s a lot more to him than that. He s a good county commissioner.  Besides, he didn t mean for the public to find out about what he d said, Bubb explains: I don t think Duane meant it to be a statement on the record. We re fairly conversational, but it is a public session. We re not necessarily making statements for the greater world. Technically, we re in public session, and I guess anything you say is a public comment. People get caught up in this  R  versus  D  and blue versus red, and we should probably try to avoid that in public session and on the record,  Bubb said.  Every public official has to decide what they want to say. Unfortunately, contrary to these assertions, this sort of thing is normal for Republicans and the remarks are typically meant for the world to hear. They use statements like this to energize their rage-fueled base, to bring in votes, to keep the divide between Americans going as much as possible. Because the reality is that they depend on this sort of thing to get elected. It s simply what works with their base   and, unfortunately, the very people who want to murder someone when they get  emotional  are the ones who want to remove restrictions on gun sales.Think about that.Featured image via Licking County official website/Getty Images (Ethan Miller)\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"politicsNews\",\n          \"Middle-east\",\n          \"worldnews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2397,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Dec 22, 2016\",\n          \"December 11, 2016 \",\n          \"July 28, 2016 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

On Monday morning, George Conway took to Twitter, Trump s favorite medium, to blast the president for his early morning tweets about his Muslim ban.On Saturday evening, Trump exploited the terrorist attacks in London to push for his Muslim ban. Because who cares that this won t keep us safe and only adds fuel to the fire.We need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 3, 2017Then on Monday, Trump really lost his sh*t over his  travel ban  that totally isn t a  ban. People, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017The Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017The Justice Dept. should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court   & seek much tougher version!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017In any event we are EXTREME VETTING people coming into the U.S. in order to help keep our country safe. The courts are slow and political!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017 These tweets may make some ppl feel better, but they certainly won t help [Trump s travel ban executive order] get 5 votes in SCOTUS, which is what actually matters,  Conway wrote.  Sad. These tweets may make some ppl feel better, but they certainly won t help OSG get 5 votes in SCOTUS, which is what actually matters. Sad. https://t.co/zVhcyfm8Hr  George Conway (@gtconway3d) June 5, 2017Conway was at the top of the short list for a job at the Justice Department, but last week he withdrew his name from consideration. It is worth noting that this tweet slamming Trump is the first one Conway has posted since 2015.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images\",\n          \"A former top aide to Donald Trump makes an alarming reference to the safety of American troops in a letter sent to Senator John McCain. In the note, Carter Page insists that an attempt from McCain, Sen. Lindsey Graham, and other Republicans interested in probing the role Russia played in the 2016 election could impact U.S. national security.Page previously served as a foreign policy adviser to Trump, and was under FBI investigation for his communications with the Russian government.In the letter, released to the propaganda site Sputnik (which is financed by the Russian government), Page wrote: Any efforts by members of Congress now to undercut potential new approaches to Russia would risk U.S. national security and innumerable service members lives,  Page said in a letter to McCain, who serves as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, sent late on Tuesday. American citizens are largely tired of failed interventionist policies.   The number of proxy wars involving Washington and Moscow across the globe still put countless lives at risk today,  Page wrote.The Trump team has mounted a full-court press opposing any attempt to investigate and probe Russian attempts to influence the election. Trump himself, responding to President Obama s expulsion of Russian spies and hackers, urged the government to move on from the hacking.The letter from Page appears to be the latest in a coordinated push back on attempts to provide accountability after the election. Republicans have been in an odd position as a result. After decades of pushing back on Russian government, including many of the public statements from Ronald Reagan, they are now backing their incoming president and his praise for the most authoritarian Russian government in decades under Vladimir Putin.By contrast, Democrats have been alarmed at the Russian behavior and Republican disinterest in making them accountable.Featured image via Flickr\",\n          \"It s almost pathetic how quickly and easily our frenemies on the Right jump to hanging people whenever they don t like them. Recently, a West Virginia lawmaker made national headlines when he said the former First Lady hung on the mall in Washington, D.C. Michael Folk, who also worked as a pilot for United Airlines, was suspended indefinitely after his words circulated and his employer was notified. But this sort of thinking, this violent desire to kill one s political enemies, is almost the norm in the GOP.Not only do we hear chants calling for Clinton s arrest and execution at GOP rallies (and even at the convention), but this sort of ugliness rears its head even in local politics. An Ohio lawmaker is under fire after he called for Clinton s execution   not because she has actually committed a crime   but just because he wants her dead.Licking County Commissioner Duane Flowers (R-epugnant), stood in a meeting of the board of commissioners and shared his thoughts Clinton Tuesday. Disgusted that the nation criticized Melania Trump for blatantly stealing part of Michelle Obama s 2008 Democratic National Convention speech, Flowers said that people should be focusing on hanging Hillary. During the meeting, he blurted out:Later in the day, after the criticism began to mount, he sad he regretted the remarks he made while  emotional. I got caught up in an emotional moment,  Flowers said.  She just totally makes my mind want to pop out of my ears. I really can t believe she s running for president. I m convinced 30 years ago, she d been locked up for life. I truly believe she has become above the law,  he added.  That s how far our system has fallen. Clinton, of course, has committed no crimes and the ones of which Republicans say she is guilty would not carry the death penalty (most of them, anyway). Unfortunately, Flowers seems to be a victim of right-wing media s incessant insistence that Clinton is a murderer and many other things she is not. As a Republican, Flowers has no choice given his mindset but to decide she should be dead.Fellow Republican and president of the board, Commissioner Tim Bubb, jumped in to defend Flowers after the remarks went public, saying that his buddy shouldn t be judged for publicly calling for the death of a high-profile political figure. I think he was on a rant and kind of venting,  Bubb said.  He sometimes wears his emotions on his sleeve. I hope you don t characterize it as that s all he is. There s a lot more to him than that. He s a good county commissioner.  Besides, he didn t mean for the public to find out about what he d said, Bubb explains: I don t think Duane meant it to be a statement on the record. We re fairly conversational, but it is a public session. We re not necessarily making statements for the greater world. Technically, we re in public session, and I guess anything you say is a public comment. People get caught up in this  R  versus  D  and blue versus red, and we should probably try to avoid that in public session and on the record,  Bubb said.  Every public official has to decide what they want to say. Unfortunately, contrary to these assertions, this sort of thing is normal for Republicans and the remarks are typically meant for the world to hear. They use statements like this to energize their rage-fueled base, to bring in votes, to keep the divide between Americans going as much as possible. Because the reality is that they depend on this sort of thing to get elected. It s simply what works with their base   and, unfortunately, the very people who want to murder someone when they get  emotional  are the ones who want to remove restrictions on gun sales.Think about that.Featured image via Licking County official website/Getty Images (Ethan Miller)\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"politicsNews\",\n          \"Middle-east\",\n          \"worldnews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It is worth noting that this tweet slamming Trump is the first one Conway has posted since 2015.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images\",\n          \"A former top aide to Donald Trump makes an alarming reference to the safety of American troops in a letter sent to Senator John McCain. In the note, Carter Page insists that an attempt from McCain, Sen. Lindsey Graham, and other Republicans interested in probing the role Russia played in the 2016 election could impact U.S. national security.Page previously served as a foreign policy adviser to Trump, and was under FBI investigation for his communications with the Russian government.In the letter, released to the propaganda site Sputnik (which is financed by the Russian government), Page wrote: Any efforts by members of Congress now to undercut potential new approaches to Russia would risk U.S. national security and innumerable service members lives,  Page said in a letter to McCain, who serves as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, sent late on Tuesday. American citizens are largely tired of failed interventionist policies.   The number of proxy wars involving Washington and Moscow across the globe still put countless lives at risk today,  Page wrote.The Trump team has mounted a full-court press opposing any attempt to investigate and probe Russian attempts to influence the election. Trump himself, responding to President Obama s expulsion of Russian spies and hackers, urged the government to move on from the hacking.The letter from Page appears to be the latest in a coordinated push back on attempts to provide accountability after the election. Republicans have been in an odd position as a result. After decades of pushing back on Russian government, including many of the public statements from Ronald Reagan, they are now backing their incoming president and his praise for the most authoritarian Russian government in decades under Vladimir Putin.By contrast, Democrats have been alarmed at the Russian behavior and Republican disinterest in making them accountable.Featured image via Flickr\",\n          \"It s almost pathetic how quickly and easily our frenemies on the Right jump to hanging people whenever they don t like them. Recently, a West Virginia lawmaker made national headlines when he said the former First Lady hung on the mall in Washington, D.C. Michael Folk, who also worked as a pilot for United Airlines, was suspended indefinitely after his words circulated and his employer was notified. But this sort of thinking, this violent desire to kill one s political enemies, is almost the norm in the GOP.Not only do we hear chants calling for Clinton s arrest and execution at GOP rallies (and even at the convention), but this sort of ugliness rears its head even in local politics. An Ohio lawmaker is under fire after he called for Clinton s execution   not because she has actually committed a crime   but just because he wants her dead.Licking County Commissioner Duane Flowers (R-epugnant), stood in a meeting of the board of commissioners and shared his thoughts Clinton Tuesday. Disgusted that the nation criticized Melania Trump for blatantly stealing part of Michelle Obama s 2008 Democratic National Convention speech, Flowers said that people should be focusing on hanging Hillary. During the meeting, he blurted out:Later in the day, after the criticism began to mount, he sad he regretted the remarks he made while  emotional. I got caught up in an emotional moment,  Flowers said.  She just totally makes my mind want to pop out of my ears. I really can t believe she s running for president. I m convinced 30 years ago, she d been locked up for life. I truly believe she has become above the law,  he added.  That s how far our system has fallen. Clinton, of course, has committed no crimes and the ones of which Republicans say she is guilty would not carry the death penalty (most of them, anyway). Unfortunately, Flowers seems to be a victim of right-wing media s incessant insistence that Clinton is a murderer and many other things she is not. As a Republican, Flowers has no choice given his mindset but to decide she should be dead.Fellow Republican and president of the board, Commissioner Tim Bubb, jumped in to defend Flowers after the remarks went public, saying that his buddy shouldn t be judged for publicly calling for the death of a high-profile political figure. I think he was on a rant and kind of venting,  Bubb said.  He sometimes wears his emotions on his sleeve. I hope you don t characterize it as that s all he is. There s a lot more to him than that. He s a good county commissioner.  Besides, he didn t mean for the public to find out about what he d said, Bubb explains: I don t think Duane meant it to be a statement on the record. We re fairly conversational, but it is a public session. We re not necessarily making statements for the greater world. Technically, we re in public session, and I guess anything you say is a public comment. People get caught up in this  R  versus  D  and blue versus red, and we should probably try to avoid that in public session and on the record,  Bubb said.  Every public official has to decide what they want to say. Unfortunately, contrary to these assertions, this sort of thing is normal for Republicans and the remarks are typically meant for the world to hear. They use statements like this to energize their rage-fueled base, to bring in votes, to keep the divide between Americans going as much as possible. Because the reality is that they depend on this sort of thing to get elected.
